Easily convert Adobe Lightroom DNG files to XMP presets for free, directly from your browser.

## About this project

This simple project uses the [exifreader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exifreader) package to extract XMP metadata from compatible files and compile it into an XML file readable by Adobe Lightroom.

## Disclaimer
